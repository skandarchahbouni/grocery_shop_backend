# Grocery Shop Application ðŸ›’ðŸŒ¿

A comprehensive backend service for a grocery shop application, built using express js (node js framework). The project structure includes:

- **config/**: Configuration files for the application.
- **controllers/**: Logic for handling requests related to products, orders, and customers.
- **errors/**: Utilities for error handling and response formatting.
- **middlewares/**: Custom middleware functions for request validation and authentication.
- **routes/**: Definitions for API endpoints related to grocery management.
- **static/images/**: Static images for the application.
- **utils/**: Utility functions to assist with various operations.

- ## Frontend Integration

The project also includes a frontend application, which was initially a pre-developed template. I migrated the template from HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to **Next.js**. After refactoring, I successfully integrated the frontend with the backend I've developed.
